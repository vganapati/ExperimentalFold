# ExperimentalFold

Retraining OpenFold with structure factor amplitudes.

## Overview

We use OpenFold and SFCalculator 
Retrain or finetune OpenFold using structure factor amplitudes from the Protein Data Bank.

## Aims

Scientific Rationale

## Setup & Installation

## Training

Only train with R_{work} structure factors

## Experiment Tracking

Weights and Biases 

## Evaluation

R_{free} and R_{work}

## Issues

Update OpenFold (opensource AlphaFold 2)
Update SFCalculator
Move to AlphaFold 3 as opensource versions in PyTorch with a training loop become available.
